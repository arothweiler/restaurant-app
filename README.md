----------------------------------
I've been working on a simple but very modern-looking site. 
This site is intended for restaurant owners. In the future,
I will continue to improve this site and more.

In this project, I've used for the first time:
SASS
SVG - Photoshop
Parallax
and other small technologies...

But I liked SASS the most, more specifically SCSS.
It makes programming much easier and faster.
I apply this technology from now on.
